 - Abstract: unchanged
 - Introduction:
   - TODO: move important information from deleted sections to introduction
   - made sure sentences are efficient
   - removed summaries of individual papers - just reference papers and give broad summaries
 - Equilibrium propagation background:
   - Deleted math described in original Scellier paper
   - Moved biological-plausibility overview from intro to this section
   - TODO: make sure important information (e.g. important parameters) are still included
   - TODO: make sure sentences are efficient
   - TODO: discuss important parameters in condensed subsection
 - Vanishing gradient background:
   - TODO: make sure sentences are efficient
   - TODO: delete unimportant information
   - TODO: remove summaries of individual papers - just reference papers and give broad summaries
 - Small-world background: deleted
   - TODO: make sure paper makes sense without it, e.g. algorithm
   - TODO: reference small-world networks and influence in introduction
 - Implementation:
   - TODO: make sure sentences are efficient
   - TODO: delete unimportant information
   - TODO: reduce number of equations; reference well-known metrics (e.g. RMS) by name
 - Results:
   - TODO: make sure sentences are efficient
   - TODO: delete unimportant information
   - TODO: consider deleting error rate as connections are added
 - Related work:
   - TODO: make sure sentences are efficient
   - TODO: minimize summary - list references, and give broad summaries
 - Discussion and future research:
   - TODO: make sure sentences are efficient
   - TODO: delete unimportant information
 - Small-world metrics appendix: deleted
   - TODO: make sure background information makes sense without it
